Things i learned:
- to override default switch behavior, rule has to use all states of the switch simultaneously with on (link to docu)
- power state cannot be used as a variable within the rule -> use temp var
- there are three rule (1,2,3) storage spaces each On is a rule, so you cant delete those rules, just the space inside them

-> Make this into a block post to not forget about this whole project
-> also write about the used component and the reason why
  
Rule1
  ON Switch1#State DO IF (Time>=Sunset OR Time<10:00) IF (%value%==1) IF ((Var2==0) AND (Var1==0)) Power1 ON; Var1 1 ENDIF; RuleTimer1 0 ELSE IF (Var1==1) RuleTimer1 10 ENDIF ENDIF ENDIF ENDON
  ON Rules#Timer=1 DO IF (Var1==1) Power1 OFF ENDIF ENDON
  ON Power1#State=0 DO Backlog Var1 0; Var2 0 ENDON
  ON Power1#State=1 DO Var2 1 ENDON
